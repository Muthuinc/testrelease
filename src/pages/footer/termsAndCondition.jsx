          platform between Merchants/Buyers. However, it does not directly offer
          pick-up and delivery or Task completion services for the Orders placed
          on the Platform. Instead, BROMAG INDIA facilitates Delivery Services
          by connecting Merchants/Buyers with DELIVERY RIDERS. If
          Merchants/Buyers encounter any issues or deficiencies in the delivery
          services or Task completion services provided by DELIVERY RIDERS,
          BROMAG INDIA will promptly notify DELIVERY RIDERS and provide
          assistance to Merchants/Buyers to address the complaint to the best of
          its abilities, ensuring a satisfactory resolution.

          BROMAG INDIA's Platform empowers Buyers to conveniently place Orders,
          which are then accepted by Merchants. In accordance with the stated
          terms and conditions, BROMAG INDIA facilitates the seamless delivery
          of goods or services through dedicated DELIVERY RIDERS. BROMAG INDIA
          does not have ownership of the products offered by the Merchants, nor
          does it engage in selling or reselling them. Additionally, BROMAG
          INDIA has no control over the Merchants or the services they provide.
          It is important for the Buyer to understand that any Order placed is
          subject to the terms and conditions stated in these Terms of Use,
          which include considerations such as product availability, delivery
          location serviceability, and acceptance of Orders, by Merchants. When
          it comes to bromag, we treat all Orders placed on our Platform and
          Delivery Services as confirmed. Nevertheless, once a Buyer
          successfully books an Order, we may give them a call on the telephone
          or mobile number they provided to verify the Order details, price, and
          estimated delivery time. To facilitate this process, the Buyer will
          need to share specific information, including their first and last
          name, mobile number, and email address. The Buyer is solely
          responsible for bringing any incorrect details to our attention.
          Furthermore, in addition to the aforementioned details, we may reach
          out to you via phone or email to notify and validate any modifications
          in the Order. Such changes may arise due to the availability or
          unavailability of certain items, alterations in the Order itself, or
          adjustments in the price as communicated by the Merchant. Kindly
          acknowledge that any alteration or confirmation of the Order will be
          considered as definitive. It is important to clarify that BROMAG INDIA
          retains the right to decline processing the Buyer's Order if the
          Buyer, Merchant, or PDP is unreachable through phone or any other
          means of communication during the confirmation call. In such an event,
          the regulations stated in the Cancellation and Refund Policy will be
          applicable. All payments made for Orders or Services on the Platform
          by you must be in Indian Rupees, which are acceptable in the Republic
          of India. Transactions involving any other currency will not be
          facilitated by the Platform for Orders or Services. You have the
          option to pay using (i) credit card, debit card, or net banking; (ii)
          any other payment method approved by RBI at the time of placing an
          Order; or (iii) credit card, debit card, or cash upon delivery. It is
          important to understand, accept, and agree that BROMAG's payment
          facility is not a banking or financial service, but rather a
          facilitator that provides an electronic, automated online payment
          system. This system allows for payment on delivery, collection, and
          remittance of transactions on the Platform, utilizing the existing
          authorized banking infrastructure and credit card payment gateway
          networks. It is important to note that BROMAG does not act as a
          trustee or in a fiduciary capacity while providing the payment
          facility. Buyers acknowledge and agree that BROMAG INDIA acts as the
          payment agent for the Merchant and DELIVERY RIDERS. BROMAG INDIA
          accepts payments from Buyers/Merchants on behalf of the Merchant. Once
          you have made the payment to BROMAG INDIA for the amounts due to the
          Merchant, your payment obligation to the Merchant is fulfilled. BROMAG
          INDIA is responsible for remitting those amounts to the Merchant. It
          is strictly prohibited to make any direct payment to the Merchant for
          Order bookings or for the delivery of the Order or completion of the
          Task made using the Platform. When placing an Order on the Platform,
          the Buyer will be prompted to provide necessary billing details,
          including their name, billing address, and credit card information.
          This information can be submitted directly to us or our trusted
          third-party payment processor, bromag. By agreeing to these Terms, the
          Buyer commits to paying for the Order in accordance with the methods
          outlined in clause VIII (6). To facilitate the collection of payment,
          the Buyer grants authorization to charge the credit card provided
          during the booking process. This charge may be processed directly by
          us or indirectly through bromag or another online payment processor
          mentioned on the Platform. In the event that the Buyer is redirected
          to bromag payment processor, they must familiarize themselves with the
          associated terms and conditions, as well as the privacy policy,
          regarding the use of this third-party service and the collection of
          personal information. It is recommended to review these terms and
          conditions before utilizing the services offered on the Platform.
          Following confirmation of the Order, a confirmation email will be sent
          to the Buyer. The Buyer will receive the final tax bill from the
          Merchant and DELIVERY RIDER (if registered for tax purposes) along
          with the Order, while BROMAG INDIA is simply facilitating the payment
          on behalf of the Merchant and DELIVERY RIDERS. The Merchant and
          DELIVERY RIDERS are responsible for determining the applicable taxes,
          their rates, and how they are applied on the bill. BROMAG INDIA does
          not bear any responsibility for the legal correctness or validity of
          these taxes. Any legal issues related to the taxes will be the sole
          responsibility of the Merchant. The prices displayed on the Bromag
          platform, which include packaging and handling charges, are determined
          solely by the Merchant and are listed based on the information
          provided by the Merchant. On rare occasions, there may be changes in
          prices at the time of placing an order due to the Merchant altering
          the menu prices without prior notice. These price changes are solely
          at the discretion of the Merchant, as they can be influenced by
          various factors beyond our control. To ensure a seamless experience
          and ongoing improvement of our application/platform, we require
          regular maintenance and upkeep. As a result, we may charge a nominal
          non-refundable amount, referred to as 'platform fees,' from you, the
          Buyer, for this purpose. Kindly be aware that the prices shown on the
          Platform may be inaccurately reflected due to technical glitches,
          typographical mistakes, or incorrect product details provided by the
          Merchant. In the event of such occurrences, the Merchant retains the
          right to cancel the Buyer's Order(s). Please note that BROMAG INDIA is
          not liable for any warranty or guarantee associated with the goods or
          services purchased by the Buyers.
